## Visual
A spry halfling woman in dark coveralls and a large straw hat covering messy red hair, carrying oversized produce in a sack.

### For the Druidic
Linda either has an incredibly green thumb or has found a way to influence her crops arcanely.

## Description
FARMING'S ALWAYS come naturally to Linda Duckett, and her kin are all proud purveyors of veggies of various sizes. That said her skillset has gained a bit of boost from the stillwater spring on her property, as it's currently functioning as a planar breech into the fey wild. As the breech grows larger, so too do Linda's crops.  In fact, she's got a pumpkin on her property she's considering turning into a four-story farmhouse.

## Wants & Needs
Linda wants a fair price for her crops, which is getting tougher given their size.

## Secret or Obstacle
The spring isn't just releasing crop-enlarging nutrients - a few sprites and satyrs have made a home in the spring, and will make their way to the surface once the moon is full.

## Carrying
2cp, 10sp; a sack of massive gourds, turnips and taters.
